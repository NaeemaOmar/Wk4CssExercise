    <p> I've always been very outspoken about my thoughts and opinions. Some could even say (rightly so) that I'm rather loud. I chose this image because it shows a lot of thoughts and ideas coming out of this ladies mouth.</p>

    <br>
    <p>I am a very extroverted person that gets energy and life from hanging out with people especially if they have good vibes. Because of that, one of the best thing I can do for my mental health is to regularly call or hangout with my friends. Unfortunately, my older sister is terribly introverted so I tend to overwhelm her with my energy when she is trying to decompress from interacting with people all day.</p>
    
    
    <div class="centerIt">
        <h2 id="Subheading">Optimistic</h2>
        <img src="/image 3 - optimistic.webp">
    </div>
    
    <br>
    <p>I tend to generally look at the bright side of things which keeps me going when things ain't too right. I always try to find the lesson or positive impact of any adverse experience because at the end of the day, I am the master of my own energy.</p>
